Hello!
This repository will be used to demonstrate foundational data science skills using the data analysis library Pandas.

Ramen is a noodle dish, widely enjoyed by university students as they spend long hours learning new skills and abilities. Therefore, I have chosen a ramen related dataset to provide evidence for the data manipulation skills I have learned. 


Source of the data:
The Ramen Rater is a product review website for the hardcore ramen enthusiast (or "ramenphile"), with over 2500 reviews to date. This dataset is an export of "The Big List" (of reviews), converted to a CSV format.

Content Overview:
Each record in the dataset is a single ramen product review. Review numbers are contiguous: more recently reviewed ramen varieties have higher numbers. Brand, Variety (the product name), Country, and Style (Cup? Bowl? Tray?) are pretty self-explanatory. Stars indicate the ramen quality, as assessed by the reviewer, on a 5-point scale; this is the most important column in the dataset!

Note that this dataset does not include the text of the reviews themselves. For that, you should browse through https://www.theramenrater.com/ instead!
